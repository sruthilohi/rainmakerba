                    The diffusion of the insights from the analytics program is crucial for 
                    success. Insights and interesting data findings such as counterintuitive 
                    findings need to be shared in interesting formats, and through the proper
                    channel. Establishing streams of insights and data stories that are 
                    minimalistic and easy-to-consume artifacts will increase acceptability and
                    adoption. Rainmaker BA strongly believes such a report should replace 
                    multi-page reports, dysfunctional and cross-linked spreadsheets, or 
                    overloaded dashboards.

                Rainmaker BA recommends ‘Data stories’ as an effective medium to present specific 
                aspects of the business, the performance of a specific product, the impact of certain
                decisions, and the results of large-scale online experiments. Data Stories enable 
                sharing of great insights to share if each ‘story’ is delivered in a smooth, 
                interactive, and engaging way. An ideal data story should be personalized, taking 
                into consideration the perspective of each target user (according to the role, 
                seniority, and line of business).
