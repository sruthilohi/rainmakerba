                                fraudulent and flag them for verification. This will help to reduce payout loss due to
                                fraud claims. Data analytics by Rainmaker BA will enable you to gain insights about how
                                internal controls are operating. Our analytics also will help you to identify instances
                                of non compliance in your organization that will help in revising or reinforcing 
                                policies.</p>
