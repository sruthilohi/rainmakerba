                    Business analytical models develop overtime and hence need dedicated effort
                    in the initial months. Also, the volume and complexity of data require a 
                    stack of advanced technologies, including high-performance data stores,
                    reliable and fast data processing pipelines, powerful analytical models,
                    flexible integration layers and interactive visualization systems.
                    The newly formed analytics team may not be able to cope with these 
                    challenges of the initial stages. Rainmaker BA can depute skilled 
                    personnel to help Clients manage this startup and transition period.

        The cost of setting up an analytics program can be discouraging and return on 
        investments are often not immediate. A poorly executed analytics program would 
        result in executives losing trust in the solution and refusing to believe the models,
        eventually abandoning the concept. Rainmaker BA can second people to manage the 
        analytics department of the client. Having knowledgeable and experienced personnel 
        seconded by Rainmaker BA can help to establish a productive analytics environment 
        and set realistic timelines for results.

        At the data layer, companies typically use combinations of Data Warehouses,
        Data Marts, Document Stores, and distributed file systems. Some corporations
        already use Data Lakes to store large volumes of data and content in their 
        original format â€” further empowering data-science teams to perform ad-hoc 
        analytical and machine learning projects. Data integration components like ETL,
        ELT and similar, are also critical here to ensure a seamless, reliable flow of
        high-quality data and content.Having personnel seconded by Rainmaker BA will enable
         companies to manage this data layer during the initial stages of the analytics program.
