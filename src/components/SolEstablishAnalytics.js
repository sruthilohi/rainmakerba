                Rainmaker BA can assist companies in planning for digital transformation and gain 
                a competitive edge by creating business value with the use of data and analytics. 
                For achieving effective data and analytics transformations, several factors must 
                be managed concurrently. Rainmaker BA can guide companies to answer core questions 
                such as whether digital transformation capabilities should address only improving 
                the core operations or also include the launching of entirely new business models.

            Digital Transformation requires answering fundamental questions on data strategy 
            such as for what the data and analytics will be used for, what nature of insights 
            from data analysis will create value and which data sets can create actionable 
            insights. Implementing an analytics program will require solving problems related 
            to data generation, collection, and organization. Rainmaker BA can enable Clients 
            to capture more data from customer interactions, supply chains, equipment, and 
            internal processes. It is to be noted that while these new streams of data create 
            business opportunities, they also simultaneously increase ambiguity, noise, and 
            complexity.

           Implementing an analytics program will require Client personnel to acquire skills needed
            to derive insights from data and use these insights into decision making. This required
            changing business processes to incorporate data insights into the actual workflow.
            Success will depend on providing the right data insights into the hands of 
            decision-makersâ€”and making sure that these executives and mid-level managers 
            understand how to use data-driven insights.

            Putting all these components in place for implementing a business analytics program 
            is not easy. To create business value using data analytics, the company needs the 
            right data, right technology, talent and culture. Acceptance of the business analytics
            culture can become a formidable task. Business analytics is still an area viewed with
            distrust by many top-level executives. In many instances, employees and teams are
            not ready to discover, interpret and use the data in decision-making processes. 
            Rainmaker BA can help Clients to develop intra-organizational trust in data-based 
            decision making. This will be achieved by presenting business analytics as 
            supportive of existing company strategies and outlining clear, measurable goals 
            that will convince slow adopters to approve a trial project.

          Insights into real business problems from analytics will be visualized as data stories to increase 
            understanding and acceptability. We at Rainmaker BA are passionate to develop a 
            special mindset in our Client organizations, i.e. a shared mentality that 
            recognizes data and insights as a catalyst towards more objective and efficient 
            decision-making processes.

            Any investment in business needs to be based on Return on Investment (ROI) 
            considerations. Rainmaker BA can develop KPIs for the analytics program that will
            measure the readiness and culture of the analytical program. This will involve
            measurement systems that capture how employees are accessing, sharing, and using 
            analytics. These KPIs will foster accountability, data-driven innovation, and 
            continuous improvement.
